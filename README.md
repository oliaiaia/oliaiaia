### Socially-Aware Navigation for Companion Robots
**C++ · Python · pybind11**

A socially-aware navigation framework based on an extended **Social Force Model**,
designed for robot motion in human-populated environments.

- Human-aware local motion regulation
- Reactive and predictive following
- Python interface for simulation and experiments

---

### Localization & Relocalization with LiDAR
**C++ · ROS · Eigen · PCL**

- EKF-based localization using wheel odometry and 3D LiDAR
- NDT-Matching for scan-to-map alignment
- Relocalization via ICP and occupancy grid search

Used in real robot systems and simulation environments.

### RRT — Rapid Random Tree Planner
**C++ · Eigen · Python · pybind11**


A C++ library for nonlinear path planning in continuous space, based on the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm. It is designed for robotics and simulations that require consideration of kinematic constraints and complex obstacles. The library includes Python bindings for intuitive integration into Python scripts and projects (e.g., for ROS, simulators, or data analysis).

---


### aStartStick — Discrete-Angle A* Planner
**C++ · Eigen · Python · pybind11**


A C++ implementation of the classic A* algorithm for pathfinding in a discrete state space, where each state is described not only by coordinates (x, y) but also by a discrete orientation (θ). This makes the algorithm applicable to robots with kinematic constraints (e.g., cars, forklifts), where turning in place is impossible or limited. The implementation focuses on efficient work with multidimensional state spaces.

---


### Kalman / Extended Kalman Filters
**C++ · Eigen**


C++ implementation for linear and nonlinear localization.

---


### Policy Planning — MDP / Cost-to-Go Planner
**C++ · Eigen · Python · pybind11**


A high-performance C++ library implementing Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Value Iteration algorithms for grid-based navigation. It supports both deterministic and stochastic environments, providing optimal policies and value/cost functions. The architecture is built using design patterns for code clarity and extensibility, with full Python bindings for ease of use.

---

###  Global Path Planning 
**C++ · ROS**

- Global planner based on a road graph and A*
- Trajectory smoothing and post-processing
- Integration with local planners and controllers

---

### Obstacles detection
**C++ · PCL**

- Point cloud filtering and segmentation
- RANSAC-based floor and wall detection
- Clustering and obstacle contour extraction (Concave Hull)
- Occupancy grid map generation from perception data
